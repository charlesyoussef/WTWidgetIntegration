# Embedding Cisco Collaboration Experience into Web Applications:

For embedding Cisco Webex Video Conferencing & collaboration experience in a Web application, the Cisco Webex Teams Widgets can be used.

Webex Teams Widgets can be included directly in your web applications, giving the ability to customize the Webex collaboration experience. They come pre-built with the Webex Teams User Interface (UI) or may be customized to your brand.

Webex Teams Widgets documentation:
https://developer.webex.com/docs/widgets

For demos or testing of Widgets, please check:

# Managing Guest Users:

For remote guest users who do not have Webex Teams accounts, the feature of "Guest Issuer" (AKA Persistent Guests) can be used to give the guest users temporary access to permanent users within your organization. For more information:

To more easily generate the guest temporary access tokens, the guestissuer CLI tool can be used:
